            <p>     SHILAN, LA TRINIDAD, Benguet-- Special Action Force (SAF) Police Staff Sgt. Reagan Salbino was one of those who had survived the five-month-long siege on the city of Marawi, 
                which started May of 2017, to recover the place from Islamic militants, led by the Maute group. He was one of the many heroes of Marawi who received a “Medalya ng Kadakilaan" or
                the PNP Heroism Medal after the siege ended in October of the same year.

            <p>Salbino got married on Dec. 20, 2018 to Fretzel, a Police Corporal assigned to the Police Regional Office in the Cordillera Mobile Force company, and dreamt of raising a family with her and living a full life.</p>
            <p>“Very proud ako sa kanya (I'm very proud of him); he fought until the end,” Fretzel, who is three months pregnant, said as she narrated the exploits of her husband.
                But fate seems to have a different plan for Salbino.
            </p>


            <p>     Salbino, a member of the 103rd Special Action Company of the Philippine National Police, was killed while serving a warrant of arrest against Abdullah Angantap Taurac for 
                homicide and illegal gun raps in the early morning of Oct. 30, 2019 in Barangay Lilod Saduc, Marawi City.
                Taurac was also killed during a shootout with police authorities that day.

            <p>Salbino's body was brought from Marawi to Shilan for a four-day wake. It was transferred to Barangay Taba-ao in Kapangan town, Salbino's birthplace, for a three-day wake, where he will be laid to rest Thursday (Nov.7).</p>
       
            <p>Mission
                Fretzel recalled how thankful she was when Salbino came home after the "Battle for Marawi" in 2017.
                “Nalasat na met diay ngem anya ngay, talaga nga adda ti misyon na siguro (He survived that but what else can we do, probably he really has a mission),” she said when asked why her husband did not ask for an assignment near Benguet.
                She said she asked him to request for transfer to a nearer region but simply shrugged his shoulders.
                “Sabi niya parang gusto ko pa doon magtrabaho pero sinasabi ko sa kanya, magpa-assign ka na dito (He told me that he still wants to work but I told him to request to be assigned here),” Fretzel said.
                Salbino joined the SAF in 2011. After taking the basic recruit course, he went on to complete his two-years commando training.
